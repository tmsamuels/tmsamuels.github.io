                Thomas Michael Samuels is currently a student at Northampton University, where he is studying Computer Science. 
                He lives in Northampton. Before attending Northampton University he studied at Northampton College where he did a two year Level 3 Diploma in Computer Systems Support and Networking. 
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Since a young age Thomas has been interested in computers and video games. One of his main pastimes is playing video games on PC with his friends. When Thomas isn’t gaming he often likes to spend time with his family doing a multitude of activities such as baking, hiking and cycling. 
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                He first became interested in the subject of computing during his time at secondary school, he found it so captivating that he decided to study it as one of his GCSE’s and eventually as an AS Level. 
                He is studying for a degree in computing and is currently on a general pathway that does a bit of everything. He wishes to specialise in a specific area, but currently does not know what pathway to choose. His main interest is computer networks/communication, although this preference could change. <br><br>
                Upon completion of his studies, Thomas would like a career in the computing industry although at the moment he is unsure what field he would like to work in. He would very much like to work in a field that he finds interesting and enjoyable.

      <h3>[The Team]</h3><br>
     
        <p>The following section contains information about the team member who worked with Thomas on the initial design for the site and helped to refine later designs.</p><br>

        <p>
                Mohammed Rahman Niyaz is currently a student at the University of Northampton, where he is studying general computing. He would like to specialise eventually, but currently does not know for sure what area to pick.     
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
                He has a wide variety of interests and hobbies, but his main one is undoubtable his keen interest in computing. Mohammed has been interested in computing and related subjects for many years and has decided that he would like to make a career in the industry. 
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
                During his free time, Mohammed loves to play video games, most recently he has become engrossed in Assassin’s Creed: Origins. When he isn’t gaming, he is likely to be keeping active by participating in sports activities and when he cannot take part he will be watching events on the television, his main interests are football and tennis but on occasion he will delve into other sports. During long periods of downtime, he loves to travel and see different places around the world.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
                After he has finished studying, he is hoping to get a successful job within the computing industry, preferably something in software engineering but he isn’t one hundred percent sure yet.

Another type of list is the nested list which is just a list within a list.</p><br><br>
            <p>24.	<a class="glossaryhyperlink" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Media_Queries">Media Queries</a> – Media Queries tie into RWD, they make it so sites can adapt to different display sizes. The media query works by checking the screen size and then changing the sites layout depending on that size. </p><br>
            <p>25.	<a class="glossaryhyperlink" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/nav">Navigation (nav)</a> – Nav is an element used in HTML that’s main purpose is to provide navigation around a site or page.

Basically the pseudo class can be added to a selected element to make it do something if it is in a certain state. An example of this would be: nav:hover {color: red}, the pseudo class is the “:hover” section and it essentially just changes the colour of the navigation bars text when the user hovers the mouse over it.</p><br>
            <p>32.	<a class="glossaryhyperlink" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Apps/Progressive/Responsive">Responsive web design (RWD)</a> – RWD is a method of web design that is aimed at making websites display properly on a wide variety of devices.

                    <p>
                        A graphic design/web developer position at Financial Data Management (FDM) which is a company located in Canning Town, London. FDM is a print and mail company and they are looking for a graphic design/web developer to design and build websites amongst other things.<br><br>

                        The job page states that the applicant should have great time management and organisational skills, as well as being able to communicate effectively. It also asks that the applicant be very creative and innovative.<br><br> The job page doesn’t state anything about having a university degree, but it does ask that the applicant have two or more years’ experience. The salary range for this particular job is between £23,000 and £27,000 with some additional benefits which the company doesn’t list on the job page. 
                    </p>
                    <br>
                <h5>Conclusion:</h5>
                    <p>
                        Out of the three jobs that have been researched only one displayed any skills in its heading section, the one that did was the Client Server job. The Client Server job heading included JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, while it was the only job to include these skills in the heading all the other jobs also required the applicant to possess them. 
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        None of the jobs that I researched required any form of university degree, but in place of it they required that the applicant have years’ of experience in the industry. The reason behind this is likely due to the fact that the jobs that have been researched are not junior level roles so the applicant is required to know more about the industry, if the jobs had been junior level ones then it would be highly likely that they would require some form of university degree instead of experience in the industry. 
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        The jobs that I reviewed all had different salary ranges, but from the three the lowest salary was £23,000 while the highest was £45,000. The salary seems to be affected by the part of London the company is located in, the closer to the centre you get the higher the salary is. This is likely due to larger companies being located nearer to the centre while smaller ones are further away, the larger companies can afford to pay more in order to get the best employees.

        <h3>[Comparison Conclusion Continued]</h3><br>
  
            <h5>Conclusion continued:</h5>
                <p>
                    All of the jobs stated that the applicant should have excellent communication skills and be able to work as a team member, this is likely due to web developers collaborating on tasks and working together to complete projects. Another non-technical skill that came up was good time management and organisational skills, this is likely to be very important to all companies as without these skills work might be late or below their required standards. Two skills that seem important to jobs that involve design are creativity and innovation, this is likely the case because companies want their designs to be unique and imaginative, not unoriginal and uninteresting. 
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    All the jobs that were researched required the applicant to have knowledge and experience with JavaScript, HTML5, and CSS3, but there were some other technical skills that came up a lot. The Client Server job required the applicant to have knowledge of certain APIs and it is likely that other jobs will require knowledge of APIs as they can be an important part of web development.<br><br>
                    One of the jobs was looking for applicants with knowledge of PHP which is a server scripting language, many companies are likely to use PHP or other server scripting language so it is a useful skill to have. Another job asked for applicants with skills relating to JavaScript frameworks such as NodeJS (server-side) and AngularJS (front-end), it is likely that some jobs will require you to have knowledge of both front-end and back-end languages Another job I researched asked the applicant to have Linux administration skills, this is unsurprising as a lot of companies have started to use Linux as their operating system instead of Windows, due to improved security and better customisation.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Overall from researching the three web development jobs, I have found out about some of the most important non-technical skills like having good communication, and I have also found out about some of the most sort after technical skills that are present in most web development jobs. 
                    I have found that most mid to high level web development jobs do not require a university degree and instead require years’ of industry experience and knowledge, I have also found that the opposite is true for junior level jobs. During my research the final thing I found is that the salary range for each job can be very different with some offering a salary in the low to high £20,000 mark while others offer nearly £50,000.

        <h3>[Design Conclusion]</h3><br>
        
            <p>
                The next segment will draw some conclusions about the design process of my website. There were four website designs that I really loved to use and look at, each of the sites had their own positive and negative aspects so when I designed my website I decided I would try to emulate some of these aspects. Originally my design had lots of different colours, but after looking at the design of other sites I realised that it would be far better to only use a couple of colours and mainly just focus on different shades of the same colour.

            <br>
            <p>
                 My original design for the website would have been a multi-page design but after looking at some single page designs I decided that a single page design is very appealing and more of a modern concept for a website. The multi-page design has been around since websites were first developed, but the single page design has recently become very popular and for good reason, I believe it makes a site feel current. My original design featured similar navigation to my final design, but due to using a single page design I had to make the navigation bar fixed. Most of the single page designs I have seen use fixed navigation as it allows the user to access the navigation no matter where they are on the page.

            <p>
                The first design for the page had been created without input from my team member, the reason for this was to see what design I could create without help from others. I worked with my team member to review my first design and come up with all the pros and cons of the design, once I had the good and bad of the site I proceeded to create a second design that improved on the bad aspects. The designs were reviewed and improved until my team member and I found them to be adequate, we also looked at the website designs that inspired my designs and found what was good and bad about them, this ensured that I would only take inspiration from the good parts of the design while making sure to avoid adding any of the bad parts.

            <br>
            <p>
                 In order to improve my design I would consult my team member before adding or removing a feature from the design, by doing this I could get another opinion on the decision and avoid making a mistake. My original design was a multi-page website that used lots of different colours, but with the help of my team I was able to improve the design so that it wasn’t grounded in the past and had a more modern and up-to-date feel.

      <h3>[Conclusion]</h3><br>
      
        <p>Over the past nine weeks I have been learning web development and in this section I will reflect upon my time learning HTML5 and CSS3. I went into learning about web development without having much knowledge of the topic, in school and college I had only designed websites using website creation sites such as Wix.com.<br><br> Learning HTML5 and CSS3 had been a new experience for me as I had never used a mark-up or styling language before. I found learning HTML5 to be very enjoyable and not too difficult, I believe this is due to the fact that I have some experience with programming languages namely VB6 and Python. I found that some of the skills I picked up while learning VB6 and Python were transferrable and made the process of learning HTML5 much easier.<br> I believe that after my first term of learning web development, I have learnt the basics of HTML5 and could now use what I have learn confidently, although I have only scratched the surface when it comes to learning HTML5.</p><br>
        
        
        <p>During the course of the first term, I also started to learn CSS3 which is used in conjunction with HTML5. I found CSS3 to be quite hard to learn in comparison to HTML5, it was a lot easier to mess up the CSS code than the HTML. Trying to get the HTML to look aesthetically pleasing using the CSS was very hard, I could make it look better than black and white plain text but I didn’t have the knowledge or understanding of CSS to make it look like a professional site. It took several lines of code in the CSS to get the HTML to look even slightly appealing. By the end of the term I learnt how to use CSS3 at a basic level, I believe that I can use it to make a site look moderately appealing but I still have a lot to learn before I can use CSS effectively.</p><br>
        
        <p>Originally I had planned to make a multi-page website but I eventually decided to make a single page site. I have found that a single page site is far better when you have less content to display and becomes quite hard to style when you have lots of content. I also found that the 1 2 3 column layout was very hard to create on a single page design. The 1 and 3 column parts were quite easy to set up but the 2 column part I found to be challenging. I believe with more experience and knowledge it would have been a lot easier to set up in a 1 2 3 column layout. </p><br>
        
        <p>Once I had started to put content onto the site I found that the pages were far too long in height, I initially decided to set the text so that scroll bars appeared and the user could scroll through the text, but I found that it hindered navigation and looked out of place on my site. I resolved the issue in the end by reducing the font size to a more appropriate level. </p><br>

        <p>Overall the past term has been very successful, I have learnt the basics of both HTML5 and CSS3. I can now create a basic site using HTML5 and can make a site look more appealing using CSS3. I have learnt a lot about website design while I was learning HTML and CSS, I now have knowledge of material design which will help me when I come to designing websites in the future.<br><br> My experience with my team member has been very enjoyable, I believe that working with another person had helped me to create a good design for my website as my teammate constantly gave me feedback about the positives and negatives of my designs. Some feedback from teammates can really help to refine designs and ensure that the end product looks attractive and works perfectly. </p><br>
        
        <p>I have come to the realisation that a single page design is not optimal for this type of content and that a multiple page design would have been easier to style. I found it very hard to style the single page design, I believe that a multiple page design would have looked far more attractive. In future I would stick to a multiple page design if I needed to display lots of content and a single page design if I had minimal content to display.</p><br>
        
        <p>In order to create the site I needed to borrow some code from various sources on the internet, the next section will look at the code I borrowed and why I needed to borrow it. The first piece of code I borrowed was from the Google Fonts API site, I needed this code to setup the font of my site. The code I borrowed linked my site to the font that I wanted to use. </p><br>
        
        <p>The next section of code I borrowed was from font awesome, I borrowed the code as I needed it to setup the icon library. Without the code I wouldn’t have been able to put icons on my site and the appeal of my design would have suffered from it.</p><br>
        
        <p>The next bit of code I borrowed related to the Google Maps map, I borrowed the code as they recommended that you should. I needed the code to display a map on my contact page, so without the code my contact page would be very bare and incomplete.</p><br>
        
        <p>I borrowed code for each of the YouTube videos on my site, the code came directly from YouTube as they suggest you use their code. I did however slightly alter the code to add the styling to the CSS instead of it being in the HTML like they suggested. Without this code I wouldn’t have been able to include any of the YouTube videos that my resources page features.</p><br>

        <p>I borrowed a large chunk of JavaScript from CSS-Tricks.com, this code enabled smooth scrolling on my site. I needed the code to make my site feel cleaner and smoother for the user, the smooth scrolling feature is key for a single page design so I needed to include it.</p><br>

        <p>The last bit of code I borrowed was from Stackoverflow.com, this code was for my CSS and is basically a simple animation that fades the images in when the site is loaded. I borrowed the code because it makes my site look better, the images no longer pop in so it doesn’t look as odd. </p><br>
